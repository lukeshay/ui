# Getting Started

This package contains the published components that were created by <ShadcnUiLink />. All credit to the components and demos goes to them.

## Installation

### 1. Install `@lshay/ui`

<InstallCommandCodeBlock />

### 2. Follow the <ShadcnUiLink /> Directions

Follow the steps <a className="underline" href="https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">linked here</a> to get started with <ShadcnUiLink />.

> NOTE: When creating the `components.json` file, the only configuration that matters is `tailwind`. The rest is handled by `@lshay/ui`. You must have `tailwind.cssVariables` set to `true` for the components to work.

> NOTE: You do not need to install `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, and `tailwind-merge` because `@lshay/ui` provides an export for `cn`, `import { cn } from "@lshay/ui/lib/utils"`.

### 3. Modify Tailwind CSS Config

Add the following to `tailwind.config.js`.

<TailwindCssConfigCodeBlock />
